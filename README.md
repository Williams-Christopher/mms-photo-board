### Summary
This is the web app client for MMS Photo Board. The API can be found at this [repo](https://github.com/Williams-Christopher/mms-photo-board-api).

MMS Photo Board is based around submission of photos with captions to a shared "photo board" via MMS (text messaging photos) and consuming them via a web application. Aside from being a relatively novel way to post to a website, the idea is that many times we might want to share a photo without having to deal with the stream of information and distration that comes to us when we open our social media applicaiton of choice. Let's explore a clean and easy way to upload photos with a mobile first application that is a core part of every mobile device and that most everyone, even grandma, can use.

The goals of the project were:
* Utilization of the Twilio SMS/MMS API to provide a more meaningful and interesting interface to a web application than account validation and password recovery.
* Explore methods to implement a 'like' system.
* Personal practice, growth, and learning.

### Tech stack
This client application utilizes the following:
* JavaScript
* CSS
* React.js
* FortAwesome
